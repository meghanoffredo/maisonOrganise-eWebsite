                <p><i>Optimized Living Space</i></p><br>
                <p>"My wife and I reached out to Maison Organisée 6 months ago to overhaul our living space - from the kitchen, to the living room, to the kid's playroom. We worked with Mindy who was excellent from start to finish. She brought tons of great experience to the table and was such a pleasure to work with along the way. She not only replicated the ideal set up we had in mind but made it 10x better. Our home is truly our happy place now and my wife and the kids couldn't be happier. Thank you, Maison Organisée!"</p><br>

                <p><i>Decluttered Bedroom Closet</i></p><br>
                <p>"I've lived in my home for nearly a decade now and my bedroom closet had just gotten out of conrol. Getting dressed every morning was becoming as struggle as I had too much stuff and didn't know where to start in optimizing my space. That's where Michael came in. Michael is a closet wizard and worked with me to understand what I truly needed to keep, how I wanted to utilize the space, and from there - he did all the dirty work in making my bedroom closet a dream. I donated several bags of unneeded clothes, kept only what I truly needed, and now - my closet is an oasis of organized items that make me happy."</p><br>

                <p><i>Zen Home Office</i></p><br>
                <p>"Because of COVID, my work moved to full-time remote. I've never worked from home before or even thought about creating a home work space; I didn't know where to start. I reached out to Maison Organisée a few months ago and got connnected with Martha. Martha has a fantastic background in interior design and lifestyle optimization. I didn't have a lot of space to work with but she made, over a quick 3 days, the home office of my dreams. It's a zen, quiet space where I can work productively, think clearly, and take virtual calls where I'm proud of my setup and surroundings. I'm loving my new remote work experience....all thanks to Martha!"</p><br>
